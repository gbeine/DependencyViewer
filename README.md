DependencyViewer
================

A graphical viewer for Dependency Finder

This tool initially developed using NetBeans.
It still depends on Swing libraries that are distributed and supported with
Netbeans 7.0.1, so this is the last version of NetBeans you should use.

The DependencyViewer uses XML files generated by DependencyFinder.
You may need to run DependencyFinder on your project before you can use
DependencyViewer.

You'll find DependencyFinder here: http://depfind.sourceforge.net/
